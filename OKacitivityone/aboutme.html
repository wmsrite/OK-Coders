	<h2>About ME</h2>
		<div id="section1">
			<p>Hi.  I am a wannabe web dev at this point in my life.  I hope, at least, at the end of my coursework for OKCoders I can change this title to Junior Web Dev.  This would allow me the confidence for a career change.  I have always enjoyed trying to find solutions the "word problems" we encounter each and everyday.  Especially when there are multiple paths to a solution, but finding the one that works best is the challenge.</p>
